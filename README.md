# Experiment---8


1. Declare different types of pointers (int, float, char) and initialize them with the
addresses of variables. Print the values of both the pointers and the variables they
point to.

2. Perform pointer arithmetic (increment and decrement) on pointers of different data
types. Observe how the memory addresses change and the effects on data
access.

3. Write a function that accepts pointers as parameters. Pass variables by reference
using pointers and modify their values within the function.
